# Reymundo Gómez: personal site foundation

Astro, reusable Markdown, and a local devenv environment for
`https://reymundo-gomez.info`.

This version has a focused professional landing page, a profile portrait, and
supporting Work History, Casework, Credentials, Expertise, Articles, and Contact pages. Reusable Markdown
supplies the content across all routes. Content entries remain drafts for local
development; an ordinary production build excludes them.

## Start locally

Install Nix and [devenv](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) on your computer, then
run these commands from this repository:

```sh
devenv shell
npm run dev
```

Open the localhost URL printed by Astro, normally `http://127.0.0.1:4321`.
devenv supplies Node and npm, installs Astro and the other project dependencies
from `package-lock.json`, and exposes the local commands inside the environment.
The first activation needs network access to download any uncached dependencies.
Subsequent activations reuse the installation while the dependency inputs match.

After `git pull`, you can keep using the same devenv shell. `npm run dev` now
checks the dependency fingerprint before starting Astro and runs `npm ci` when
the lockfile, declared dependencies, or Node runtime has changed. The checker
uses only Node built-ins, so it also works when a newly added package is missing.
The same check runs before content checks, tests, and previews. If installation
fails, startup stops with the installation error; `npm ci` is the manual repair.

You can also run `devenv up` to initialize the environment and start the configured
site process in one command.

Node 24 is selected in `devenv.nix`. The npm dependency versions are pinned in
`package-lock.json`, and `devenv.yaml` pins the nixpkgs input to an exact revision.
The first `devenv shell` creates `devenv.lock`; commit that generated lockfile.
Nix and devenv were unavailable in the scaffold environment, so their activation
has not been executed there. The Astro checks and builds are verified separately.

The included `.envrc` is optional. If you use direnv, review it and run
`direnv allow`. Otherwise, continue using `devenv shell`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Live local preview, including drafts |
| `npm run check:content` | Check Markdown fields, dates, IDs, and references |
| `npm run check` | Content checks and Astro/TypeScript diagnostics |
| `npm run build` | Check and compile published content into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Inspect the published-content build locally |
| `npm run build:drafts` | Check and compile all content into `dist-drafts/` |
| `npm run preview:drafts` | Inspect the separate draft build locally |
| `npm test` | Check important invalid-content cases |

The devenv shell also provides `site-check`, `site-build`, and `site-drafts` as
shortcuts. `site-setup` remains available to force a clean dependency reinstall
when troubleshooting; it is not required for normal startup.

All initial entries are drafts, so the ordinary build intentionally shows only
“Site in preparation.” Use `npm run dev` to see the populated content preview.
Draft builds are stored separately to keep them out of a future `dist/` upload.
Keep `CONTENT_PREVIEW` unset during normal builds. Both preview modes currently
include `noindex` metadata; public launch will include a deliberate metadata pass.

## Edit content

Start with [the content guide](docs/content-guide.md). Copy an appropriate file
from `templates/` into the matching collection under `content/`.

| Directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `content/profile/` | Identity, public contact fields, and biography variants |
| `content/experience/` | Employment roles, date ranges, and achievement bullets |
| `content/education/` | Degrees and attendance records |
| `content/credentials/` | Certifications, certificates, and training |
| `content/expertise/` | Areas of expertise |
| `content/projects/` | Selected work and public project references |
| `content/interests/` | Personal interests |
| `content/callouts/` | Independently reusable passages |
| `content/charts/` | Category definitions for record-derived donut charts |
| `content/cases/` | One structured record per case, driving charts and statistics |
| `content/articles/` | Articles with dates, topics, takeaways, and related cases |
| `content/pages/` | Page introductions and selected content IDs |
| `templates/` | Copyable examples; never loaded into the site |
| `src/content/schemas.ts` | Shared authoring rules |
| `src/components/` | Reusable rendering components |
| `src/pages/` | Website routes |

Each file in `content/pages/` controls navigation, section order, and selections.
Work History automatically discovers job files and uses their `display_order`.
The home page presents a small selection; the supporting pages provide the full
background and details. Other content files supply the writing. See
[the page structure guide](docs/page-structure.md) for the route map and portrait.

## Access through Tailscale

Keep Astro bound to localhost. If using Tailscale Serve, allow only your exact
Tailscale hostname before starting Astro:

```sh
export TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME=your-device.your-tailnet.ts.net
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal:

```sh
tailscale serve 4321
```

Use the HTTPS URL returned by Tailscale. Check Astro's printed port if 4321 is
already occupied. This project does not start or configure Tailscale automatically.
See [local development](docs/local-development.md) for persistent server notes.

## Public hosting later

The intended host is Cloudflare Pages connected directly to the private GitHub
repository. Use `npm run build` as its build command and `dist` as its output
directory, with Node 24. GitHub Actions is not required. No Cloudflare project,
DNS records, GitHub Actions workflows, or public site are created by this scaffold.

## Resume content

The content inventory contains 64 draft entries: one profile, six roles, eleven
credentials and training records, three education records, seven expertise areas,
two selected-work entries, nine interests, two callouts, two case charts,
thirteen example cases, one starter article, and seven page selections.

Casework is a Markdown-backed tracker. Add a record under `content/cases/` and
its chart count, category share, and statistics update from that record. Real
cases and examples use separate datasets. Charts store no manual counts.

Pagefind adds case search with per-case filters and direct links into summaries.
Search refreshes from Markdown in local development and is generated with static
builds. Content collections accept both `.md` and `.mdx`. The Articles section
automatically discovers both formats, including files in subfolders.
See [articles, search, and future editor storage](docs/articles-and-search.md).

Astro Icon supplies locally bundled Lucide icons. OpenGraph Canvas generates
social sharing images from visible page, article, and case category content, using
locally installed Inter fonts. Every page has an optional tsParticles network
background with a remembered pause control and support for reduced motion.
Node count, size, connection distance, and speed are set in `src/config/particles.json`.
See [MDX and visual integrations](docs/mdx-and-visuals.md) for editing examples and settings.

Start with [the case record guide](docs/case-tracker.md) and `templates/cases.md`.
See [page structure](docs/page-structure.md) for job ordering, timeline behavior,
navigation, the Contact page, portrait replacement, and dark mode.

See [the resume review notes](docs/resume-content-review.md) for source ambiguities
and details that still need confirmation. The supplied PDF, personal contact
details, and professional references are not included. Draft status controls the
website build; the Markdown and editorial notes remain visible in GitHub while
the repository is public.

This repository is not licensed for third-party reuse.

# Local development with devenv

`devenv.nix` provides Node 24, npm, Git, and a foreground site process. It also
enables `languages.javascript.npm.install.enable`, which installs Astro and the
other project dependencies during environment activation. Astro is pinned in
`package-lock.json` and installed into this project's `node_modules/` directory.
devenv adds the local executables to the environment's PATH.

Run `devenv shell`, then `npm run dev`, or run `devenv up` to initialize the
environment and start the site process together. No manual `npm ci` step is
required. The first activation needs network access for uncached dependencies.

## Reproducibility

Run `devenv shell` and commit the resulting `devenv.lock` after successful
activation. The existing `devenv.yaml` already selects an exact nixpkgs commit.
Update the input deliberately when you want a newer Node/Nix package set; then
regenerate and commit the lockfile. npm's separate lockfile is already included.

On activation, devenv checks the dependency inputs and installs the locked graph
when needed. With `package-lock.json` present, its npm integration uses
`npm clean-install` (equivalent to `npm ci`). This installs the recorded versions;
it does not upgrade dependencies. Re-enter the environment after pulling changes
to the dependency files.

For intentional dependency changes, edit the manifest and use `npm install`
inside the devenv shell to update the lockfile. Commit both files together.
The optional `site-setup` command forces a clean reinstall for troubleshooting.

The example input is documented by [devenv's input guide](https://devenv.sh/inputs/).
See [JavaScript options](https://devenv.sh/languages/javascript/) and
[process management](https://devenv.sh/processes/).

## Local settings

Use `devenv.local.nix` or `devenv.local.yaml` for machine-specific overrides; both
are ignored by Git. The optional `.envrc` enables direnv integration. Export
`TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME` in the shell before starting Astro if using Tailscale Serve.
The `.env.example` documents that variable; the Astro config intentionally reads
the shell environment, rather than assuming a copied `.env` file is loaded.

## Serving through Tailscale

Astro listens on `127.0.0.1`. Set the exact Tailscale hostname so Astro accepts the
proxy's Host header, then run `tailscale serve 4321` in a separate terminal. Use
the actual port printed by Astro if it differs. Ctrl+C ends the foreground Serve
session. For an existing background Serve configuration, inspect
`tailscale serve status` before changing it.

Tailscale Serve is restricted to the tailnet and provides a tailnet HTTPS name.
It may request enabling tailnet HTTPS on first use. Tailscale is assumed to be
installed and managed on your host OS; it is not installed as a development daemon.

For a permanently running version on your home server, use `npm run build` and
serve the resulting `dist/` through your normal static web server, then point
Tailscale Serve at that server. `astro preview` is a development preview, not a
production server. [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/tailscale-serve)

## Cloudflare Pages later

When ready, create a Pages project with Git integration and authorize access to
this repository. Set Node 24, build command `npm run build`, and output directory
`dist`. Keep `CONTENT_PREVIEW` unset. The same validation runs locally and there.

Git integration can later have automatic builds disabled while still accepting
manual Wrangler deployments. A Direct Upload project cannot later enable Git
integration without creating a new project.

Add `reymundo-gomez.info` to the Pages project's custom domains at launch. Serving
the apex through Pages requires Cloudflare nameservers; registration can remain
with the existing registrar. No GitHub Actions workflow is needed.
